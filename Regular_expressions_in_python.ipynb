        "# Introduction\n",
        "Regular expressions (called REs, or regexes, or regex patterns) are essentially a tiny, highly specialized programming language embedded inside Python and made available through the re module. Using this little language, you specify the rules for the set of possible strings that you want to match; this set might contain English sentences, or e-mail addresses, or TeX commands, or anything you like. You can then ask questions such as “Does this string match the pattern?”, or “Is there a match for the pattern anywhere in this string?”. You can also use REs to modify a string or to split it apart in various ways.\n",
        "\n",
        "Regular expression patterns are compiled into a series of bytecodes which are then executed by a matching engine written in C. For advanced use, it may be necessary to pay careful attention to how the engine will execute a given RE, and write the RE in a certain way in order to produce bytecode that runs faster. Optimization isn’t covered in this document, because it requires that you have a good understanding of the matching engine’s internals.\n",
        "\n",
        "The regular expression language is relatively small and restricted, so not all possible string processing tasks can be done using regular expressions. There are also tasks that can be done with regular expressions, but the expressions turn out to be very complicated. In these cases, you may be better off writing Python code to do the processing; while Python code will be slower than an elaborate regular expression, it will also probably be more understandable."

        "# Simple Patterns\n",
        "We’ll start by learning about the simplest possible regular expressions. Since regular expressions are used to operate on strings, we’ll begin with the most common task: matching characters.\n",
        "\n",
        "For a detailed explanation of the computer science underlying regular expressions (deterministic and non-deterministic finite automata), you can refer to almost any textbook on writing compilers.\n",
        "\n",
        "Matching Characters\n",
        "Most letters and characters will simply match themselves. For example, the regular expression test will match the string test exactly. (You can enable a case-insensitive mode that would let this RE match Test or TEST as well; more about this later.)\n",
        "\n",
        "There are exceptions to this rule; some characters are special metacharacters, and don’t match themselves. Instead, they signal that some out-of-the-ordinary thing should be matched, or they affect other portions of the RE by repeating them or changing their meaning. Much of this document is devoted to discussing various metacharacters and what they do.\n",
        "\n",
        "Here’s a complete list of the metacharacters; their meanings will be discussed in the rest of this HOWTO.\n",
        "\n",
        ". ^ $ * + ? { } [ ] \\ | ( )\n",
        "\n",
        "The first metacharacters we’ll look at are [ and ]. They’re used for specifying a character class, which is a set of characters that you wish to match. Characters can be listed individually, or a range of characters can be indicated by giving two characters and separating them by a '-'. For example, [abc] will match any of the characters a, b, or c; this is the same as [a-c], which uses a range to express the same set of characters. If you wanted to match only lowercase letters, your RE would be [a-z].\n",
        "\n",
        "Metacharacters (except \\) are not active inside classes. For example, [akm$] will match any of the characters 'a', 'k', 'm', or '$'; '$' is usually a metacharacter, but inside a character class it’s stripped of its special nature.\n",
        "\n",
        "You can match the characters not listed within the class by complementing the set. This is indicated by including a '^' as the first character of the class. For example, [^5] will match any character except '5'. If the caret appears elsewhere in a character class, it does not have special meaning. For example: [5^] will match either a '5' or a '^'.\n",
        "\n",
        "Perhaps the most important metacharacter is the backslash, \\. As in Python string literals, the backslash can be followed by various characters to signal various special sequences. It’s also used to escape all the metacharacters so you can still match them in patterns; for example, if you need to match a [ or \\, you can precede them with a backslash to remove their special meaning: \\[ or \\\\.\n",
        "\n",
        "Some of the special sequences beginning with '\\' represent predefined sets of characters that are often useful, such as the set of digits, the set of letters, or the set of anything that isn’t whitespace.\n",
        "\n",
        "Let’s take an example: \\w matches any alphanumeric character. If the regex pattern is expressed in bytes, this is equivalent to the class [a-zA-Z0-9_]. If the regex pattern is a string, \\w will match all the characters marked as letters in the Unicode database provided by the unicodedata module. You can use the more restricted definition of \\w in a string pattern by supplying the re.ASCII flag when compiling the regular expression.\n",
        "\n",
        "The following list of special sequences isn’t complete. For a complete list of sequences and expanded class definitions for Unicode string patterns, see the last part of Regular Expression Syntax in the Standard Library reference. In general, the Unicode versions match any character that’s in the appropriate category in the Unicode database.\n",
        "\n",
        "\\d\n",
        "Matches any decimal digit; this is equivalent to the class [0-9].\n",
        "\n",
        "\\D\n",
        "Matches any non-digit character; this is equivalent to the class [^0-9].\n",

        "\\S\n",
        "Matches any non-whitespace character; this is equivalent to the class [^ \\t\\n\\r\\f\\v].\n",
        "\n",
        "\\w\n",

        "\n",
        "These sequences can be included inside a character class. For example, [\\s,.] is a character class that will match any whitespace character, or ',' or '.'.\n",
        "\n",
        "The final metacharacter in this section is .. It matches anything except a newline character, and there’s an alternate mode (re.DOTALL) where it will match even a newline. . is often used where you want to match “any character”."

        "A step-by-step example will make this more obvious. Let’s consider the expression a[bcd]*b. This matches the letter 'a', zero or more letters from the class [bcd], and finally ends with a 'b'. Now imagine matching this RE against the string 'abcbd'.\n",

        "The end of the RE has now been reached, and it has matched 'abcb'. This demonstrates how the matching engine goes as far as it can at first, and if no match is found it will then progressively back up and retry the rest of the RE again and again. It will back up until it has tried zero matches for [bcd]*, and if that subsequently fails, the engine will conclude that the string doesn’t match the RE at all.\n",
        "\n",
        "Another repeating metacharacter is +, which matches one or more times. Pay careful attention to the difference between * and +; * matches zero or more times, so whatever’s being repeated may not be present at all, while + requires at least one occurrence. To use a similar example, ca+t will match 'cat' (1 'a'), 'caaat' (3 'a's), but won’t match 'ct'.\n",
